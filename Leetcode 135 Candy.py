135 Candy
There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.
You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:
Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.

Example 1:
        Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
        Output: 5
        Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.

Example 2:
        Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
        Output: 4
        Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
        The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.

Constraints:
        n == ratings.length
        1 <= n <= 2 * 104
        0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 104
