Leetcode 326 Power of Three
 
Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of three. Otherwise, return false.
An integer n is a power of three, if there exists an integer x such that n == 3x. 

Example 1:
        Input: n = 27
        Output: true
        Explanation: 27 = 33

Example 2:
        Input: n = 0
        Output: false
        Explanation: There is no x where 3x = 0.
        
Example 3:
        Input: n = -1
        Output: false
        Explanation: There is no x where 3x = (-1).
 
Constraints:
        -231 <= n <= 231 - 1

        Determine whether an integer is a power of three.

        Parameters
        ----------
        n : int
            The integer to test. Any Python int is accepted (negative, zero, or positive).

        Returns
        -------
        bool
            True if `n` is a positive power of three (1, 3, 9, 27, ...), otherwise False.

        Notes
        -----
        - Uses an O(1) divisibility trick for the 32-bit signed integer range:
          the largest power of 3 in this range is 3**19 = 1_162_261_467.
          For any positive `n` within that range, `n` is a power of three iff
          `1_162_261_467 % n == 0`.
        - For larger integers, falls back to an O(logâ‚ƒ n) loop.
