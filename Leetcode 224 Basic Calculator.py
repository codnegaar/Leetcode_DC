224 Basic Calculator
 
Given a string s representing a valid expression, implement a basic calculator to evaluate it, and return the result of the evaluation.

Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as eval().

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "1 + 1"
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: s = " 2-1 + 2 "
Output: 3
Example 3:

Input: s = "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)"
Output: 23
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105
s consists of digits, '+', '-', '(', ')', and ' '.
s represents a valid expression.
'+' is not used as a unary operation (i.e., "+1" and "+(2 + 3)" is invalid).
'-' could be used as a unary operation (i.e., "-1" and "-(2 + 3)" is valid).
There will be no two consecutive operators in the input.
Every number and running calculation will fit in a signed 32-bit integer.

class Solution:
  def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:
    ans = 0
    num = 0
    sign = 1
    stack = [sign]  # stack[-1]: current env's sign

    for c in s:
      if c.isdigit():
        num = num * 10 + (ord(c) - ord('0'))
      elif c == '(':
        stack.append(sign)
      elif c == ')':
        stack.pop()
      elif c == '+' or c == '-':
        ans += sign * num
        sign = (1 if c == '+' else -1) * stack[-1]
        num = 0

    return ans + sign * num
