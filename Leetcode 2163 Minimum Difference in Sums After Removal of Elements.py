Leetcode 2163 Minimum Difference in Sums After Removal of Elements

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums consisting of 3 * n elements.
You are allowed to remove any subsequence of elements of size exactly n from nums. The remaining 2 * n elements will be divided into two equal parts:
The first n elements belonging to the first part and their sum is sumfirst.
The next n elements belonging to the second part and their sum is sumsecond.
The difference in sums of the two parts is denoted as sumfirst - sumsecond.
For example, if sumfirst = 3 and sumsecond = 2, their difference is 1.
Similarly, if sumfirst = 2 and sumsecond = 3, their difference is -1.
Return the minimum difference possible between the sums of the two parts after the removal of n elements.

Example 1:
        Input: nums = [3,1,2]
        Output: -1
        Explanation: Here, nums has 3 elements, so n = 1. 
        Thus we have to remove 1 element from nums and divide the array into two equal parts.
        - If we remove nums[0] = 3, the array will be [1,2]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 1 - 2 = -1.
        - If we remove nums[1] = 1, the array will be [3,2]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 3 - 2 = 1.
        - If we remove nums[2] = 2, the array will be [3,1]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 3 - 1 = 2.
        The minimum difference between sums of the two parts is min(-1,1,2) = -1. 

Example 2:
        Input: nums = [7,9,5,8,1,3]
        Output: 1
        Explanation: Here n = 2. So we must remove 2 elements and divide the remaining array into two parts containing two elements each.
        If we remove nums[2] = 5 and nums[3] = 8, the resultant array will be [7,9,1,3]. The difference in sums will be (7+9) - (1+3) = 12.
        To obtain the minimum difference, we should remove nums[1] = 9 and nums[4] = 1. The resultant array becomes [7,5,8,3]. The difference in sums of the two parts is (7+5) - (8+3) = 1.
        It can be shown that it is not possible to obtain a difference smaller than 1.
         
Constraints:        
        nums.length == 3 * n
        1 <= n <= 105
        1 <= nums[i] <= 105

# ðŸ”„ Changes Made:
- Added complete docstring and line-by-line comments.
- Cleaned variable names for better readability (e.g., `prefSum` â†’ `left_sum`).
- Ensured clarity of logic by separating heap operations.
- Added a full unit test using `unittest` framework.
- Improved clarity, not asymptotic complexity (still O(n log n) due to heaps).
- Removed redundant allocation of heap elements outside necessary ranges.
