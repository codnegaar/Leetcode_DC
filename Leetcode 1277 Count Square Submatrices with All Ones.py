Leetcode 1277 Count Square Submatrices with All Ones

Given a m * n matrix of ones and zeros, return how many square submatrices have all ones.

Example 1:
        Input: matrix =
                        [
                          [0,1,1,1],
                          [1,1,1,1],
                          [0,1,1,1]
                        ]
        Output: 15
        Explanation: 
        There are 10 squares of side 1.
        There are 4 squares of side 2.
        There is  1 square of side 3.
        Total number of squares = 10 + 4 + 1 = 15.

Example 2:        
        Input: matrix = 
                        [
                          [1,0,1],
                          [1,1,0],
                          [1,1,0]
                        ]
        Output: 7
        Explanation: 
        There are 6 squares of side 1.  
        There is 1 square of side 2. 
        Total number of squares = 6 + 1 = 7.
 

Constraints:
        1 <= arr.length <= 300
        1 <= arr[0].length <= 300
        0 <= arr[i][j] <= 1
