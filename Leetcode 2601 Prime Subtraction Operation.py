Leetcode 2601 Prime Subtraction Operation

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n.
You can perform the following operation as many times as you want:
        Pick an index i that you haven’t picked before, and pick a prime p strictly less than nums[i], then subtract p from nums[i].
        Return true if you can make nums a strictly increasing array using the above operation and false otherwise.
        A strictly increasing array is an array whose each element is strictly greater than its preceding element.     

Example 1:
        Input: nums = [4,9,6,10]
        Output: true
        Explanation: In the first operation: Pick i = 0 and p = 3, and then subtract 3 from nums[0], so that nums becomes [1,9,6,10].
        In the second operation: i = 1, p = 7, subtract 7 from nums[1], so nums becomes equal to [1,2,6,10].
        After the second operation, nums is sorted in strictly increasing order, so the answer is true.

Example 2:
        Input: nums = [6,8,11,12]
        Output: true
        Explanation: Initially nums is sorted in strictly increasing order, so we don't need to make any operations.

Example 3:
        Input: nums = [5,8,3]
        Output: false
        Explanation: It can be proven that there is no way to perform operations to make nums sorted in strictly increasing order, so the answer is false.
         

Constraints:
        1 <= nums.length <= 1000
        1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
        nums.length == n
