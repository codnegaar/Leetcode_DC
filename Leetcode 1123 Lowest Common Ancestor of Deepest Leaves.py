Leetcode 1123 Lowest Common Ancestor of Deepest Leaves
 
Given the root of a binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor of its deepest leaves.
Recall that:
The node of a binary tree is a leaf if and only if it has no children
The depth of the root of the tree is 0. if the depth of a node is d, the depth of each of its children is d + 1.
The lowest common ancestor of a set S of nodes, is the node A with the largest depth such that every node in S is in the subtree with root A.
 
Example 1:
        Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]
        Output: [2,7,4]
        Explanation: We return the node with value 2, colored in yellow in the diagram.
        The nodes coloured in blue are the deepest leaf-nodes of the tree.
        Note that nodes 6, 0, and 8 are also leaf nodes, but the depth of them is 2, but the depth of nodes 7 and 4 is 3.

Example 2:
        Input: root = [1]
        Output: [1]
        Explanation: The root is the deepest node in the tree, and it's the lca of itself.

Example 3:
        Input: root = [0,1,3,null,2]
        Output: [2]
        Explanation: The deepest leaf node in the tree is 2, the lca of one node is itself. 

Constraints:
        The number of nodes in the tree will be in the range [1, 1000].
        0 <= Node.val <= 1000
        The values of the nodes in the tree are unique.
